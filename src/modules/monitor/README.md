# Circle CI API : how to check execution status of a pipeline

### About Circle CI Pipelines Workflow execution `status` values : One question



* The `status`, returned for the workflow execution (`https://circleci.com/api/v2/pipeline/${PIPELINE_ID}/workflow`), of a `Circle CI` pipeline, can have one of the following values :

| CircleCI Pipeline Workflow Execution Status value  |  Description  of what happened                                                                  |
|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `success`                                          |  execution completed without any error                                                          |
| `running`                                          |  execution is running                                                                           |
| `not_run`                                          |  execution is scheduled, but did not start yet                                                  |
| `failed`                                           |  execution completed with errors                                                                |
| `error`                                            |  execution was canceled, because of `.circleci/config.yml` syntax errors                        |
| `failing`                                          |  execution is still running, and at least one error already occured, without stopping execution |
| `on_hold`                                          |  someone paused the execution                                                                   |
| `canceled`                                         |  someone canceled the execution                                                                 |
| `unauthorized`                                     |  an unauthorized Circle CI user requested the execution, using `Circle CI` API, and it was therefore denied |

* My question is : Are all _Descriptions of what happened_ definitely right? On which of them am I wrong ? Where I am wrong, what does the value means (What happened) ?

* Assuming I am right about all those "_descriptions of what happened_", here is how i can classify thoses statuses :

  * `status` values for which we know it is not even worth waiting to expect any further execution `status` change, regardless of any error(s) :

  | CircleCI Pipeline Workflow Execution Status value  |  Description  of what happened                                                                  |
  |----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | `success`                                          |  execution completed without any error                                                          |
  | `failed`                                           |  execution completed with errors                                                                |
  | `error`                                            |  execution was canceled, because of `.circleci/config.yml` syntax errors                        |
  | `on_hold`                                          |  someone paused the execution (we will never manually pause a pipeline execution, either with Web UI or Circle CI API)                                                                  |
  | `canceled`                                         |  someone canceled the execution                                                                 |
  | `unauthorized`                                     |  an unauthorized Circle CI user requested the execution, using `Circle CI` API, and it was therefore denied |

  * `status` values for which we know the pipeline is still running, or will run, if we wait some more :

  | CircleCI Pipeline Workflow Execution Status value  |  Description  of what happened                                                                  |
  |----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | `running`                                          |  execution is running                                                                           |
  | `not_run`                                          |  execution is scheduled, but did not start yet                                                  |
  | `failing`                                          |  execution is still running, and at least one error already occured, without stopping execution |


* _**Note**_ : You need the pipeline execution Id, which is a UUID, to browse workflows executions, of a pipeline execution. Below, you can see that the `Ã¬tems` array in JSON response, lists all "`workflow`" executions (and give their status):
