# Circle CI Orbs for the Gravitee.io Team


### A First simple Orb

First, I will try and make a simple `Orb`, including the `.circleci/config.yml` defined for
all Gravitee "dev repos", cf. :
* `src/modules/circleci/status/tests/.circleci/config.yml` (actually deployed by scripts)
* `documentation/cci-pipelines-commons/.circleci/config.yml` : should always be the same as `src/modules/circleci/status/tests/.circleci/config.yml`
