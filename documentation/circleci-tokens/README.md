# Circle Ci Tokens Life Cycle in the `Gravitee Release Orchestrator`

The life cycle is simple :
* create the token
* revoke the token

see https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/managing-api-tokens/

Now, What I need, is a way to revoke the token with API call :
* meaning there is on user token, not a bot token, that is to be used to manage all Gravitee Bots Circle CI Tokens
* TODO : check about API calls to do that
